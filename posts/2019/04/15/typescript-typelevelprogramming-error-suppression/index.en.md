When type level programming, various errors occur.So we need to suppress it.  
This article introduces two ways to suppress errors.  
I checked with v3.4.2.


## Suppress type constraint error
There are operations in TS that can only be of the type that satisfies the condition.
Here are some examples.

```ts
type F<T extends any[]> = T;
type X = F<A>;// A require to extends any[]
type Y = B["x"]// B require object type and have roperty named `x`
```

However, even if it is known that the condition is satisfies, an error may occur.  
At such time, let's define and use the following `Cast` type.  
This is used by coding `Cast<T, P>` when it is known that `T` extends `P`.

```ts
type Cast<T, P> = T extends P ? T : P;
```

example

```ts
type F<T> = "x" extends keyof T ? T : { x: 1 };
type G<T> = F<T>["x"];
```

We know that the result of `F<T>` have roperty named `x`.But an error occurs.  
You solve it by coding as follows.

```ts
type G<T> = Cast<F<T>, { x: any }>["x"];
```

## Suppress `Type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite.`
There are two types of errors.

1. When type parameter does not exist
2. When type parameter does exist

1 can not be suppressed because it exceeds the limit of recursion.  
However, 2 can be suppressed.
  
When `F` and `G` are complex type constructors including recursion etc, an error will occur if coding the following:

```ts
type X<T> = G<F<T>>;
```

However, even if `G` is not so complicated, errors may occur.(need investigation)  
At this time, it is solved by coding as follows.

```ts
type X<T> = G<F<T> extends infer A ? A : never>;
```

Complex type constructors often can not be used to infer type checking, so they are often used with `Cast`.

```ts
type X<T> = G<F<T> extends infer A ? Cast<A, any[]> : never>;
```
  
Checking became severe in TS3.4, and it became mandatory to use this technique.  
[issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/30188)

An example where an error occurs.

```ts
type Head<T extends any[], D = never> = T extends [infer X, ...any[]] ? X : D;
type Tail<T extends any[]> = ((...x: T) => void) extends ((x: any, ...xs: infer XS) => void) ? XS : never
type Cons<X, XS extends any[]> = ((h: X, ...args: XS) => void) extends ((...args: infer R) => void) ? R : [];
type Reverse<L extends any[], X extends any[] = []> = {
  1: X, 0: Reverse<Tail<L>, Cons<Head<L>, X>>
}[L extends [] ? 1 : 0];

type X<T extends any[]> = Reverse<Reverse<T>>;
```

Solution.

```ts
type X<T extends any[]> = Reverse<Reverse<T> extends infer A ? Cast<A, any[]> : never>;
```

Examples of 1.

```ts
type X = Reverse<[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]>;
```

This needs to stop dealing with large sized data, or be devised to reduce type recursion.
